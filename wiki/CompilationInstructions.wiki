Since the library uses `automake` to generate a custom Makefile, the user must have, along with basic build tools, it installed on their system. `*`NIX systems usually come pre-installed with those packages.

The user should then run
<code language="sh">bash autogen.sh</code>
which uses the configure.ac file to generate a configure script. Then, running 
<code language="sh">./configure && make && sudo make install</code>
should do the trick. 

The library is installed to `/usr/local/lib` by default, so make sure that your compiler looks for libraries in that folder.
