= Introduction =
Since the library uses `automake` to generate a custom Makefile, the user must have, along with basic build tools, it installed on their system. `*`NIX systems usually come pre-installed with those packages.

The user should then run
<code language="sh">bash autogen.sh</code>
which uses the configure.ac file to generate a configure script. Then, running 
<code language="sh">./configure && make && sudo make install</code>
should do the trick. 

The library is installed to `/usr/local/lib` by default, so make sure that your compiler looks for libraries in that folder. 

= Instructions for specific operating systems =
== Ubuntu ==

This procedure was tested on Ubuntu 10.04 and 12.04. The first line ensures that the build environment is setup properly. The last line ensures the linker finds the shared object library. It might or might not be necessary to run this command, but in any case it should not break your system.
<code language="sh">
sudo apt-get install gfortran g++ automake build-essential libtool
bash autogen.sh
./configure && make && sudo make install
sudo ldconfig
</code>
On some older Ubuntu versions, the following error message can popup while running `autogen.sh`
<code>
configure.ac: error: possibly undefined macro: AM_PROG_AR
</code>
In that case, the following line can be commented out in `configure.ac`
<code>
AM_PROG_AR
</code>
